# Index\-based pruning in ClickHouse

![](/_next/image?url=%2Fuploads%2Fmark_needham_a17c08008e.png&w=96&q=75)[Mark Needham](/authors/mark-needham)Apr 15, 2026 · 10 minutes readThe fastest analytical queries are the ones that read the least data. We know we say that a lot, but that’s only because it’s true!


ClickHouse has several ways to make this happen. In this blog post, we'll use a dataset of UK property sales to walk through three index\-based pruning techniques \- so you know exactly what to reach for and when.


## Pruning technique \#1: Primary index [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#pruning_technique_1_primary_index)


The first pruning technique, the primary key, is one of the first things that you learn when creating a table. A table’s primary key determines the sort order of the data within a data part.


Table parts are comprised of granules, each containing 8,192 rows by default. ClickHouse’s primary index stores the [primary key column values for the first row in every granule](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/best-practices/sparse-primary-indexes#the-primary-index-has-one-entry-per-granule).


In the diagram below, data is sorted by the primary key, `C1`, and rows are organized into granules (`g1` to `g4`). We use 3 rows per granule in this diagram for clarity. The primary index stores the first value for each granule, i.e., 10 for `g1`, 20 for `g2`, and so on.


![](/uploads/pruning_001_767cab4175.png)
The primary index allows entire granules to be skipped before reading them, based on the filter condition on the primary key. For example, for a query that contains `WHERE C1 > 60`, granules `g1` and `g2` are pruned using the index, so only the remaining data is read.


## Pruning technique \#2: Lightweight projections [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#pruning_technique_2_lightweight_projections)


Our next pruning technique is [lightweight projections](https://clickhouse.com/blog/projections-secondary-indices), which was first introduced in [ClickHouse 25\.6](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-25-06#filtering-by-multiple-projections) and received a more user\-friendly syntax in [ClickHouse 26\.1](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-26-01#new-syntax-for-indexing-projections).


Projections in ClickHouse are automatically maintained, hidden table copies stored in a different sort order, and therefore with a different primary index. These alternative layouts can speed up queries that benefit from those orderings. The downside is that projections duplicated the base table’s data on disk.


Lightweight projections behave like a secondary index without duplicating full rows. Instead of storing complete data copies, they store only their sorting key plus a `_part_offset` pointer back into the base table. This greatly reduces storage overhead but means that any other returned columns must be read from the base table.


We can see how this works by updating our diagram to add a lightweight projection on `C2`:


![](/uploads/pruning_002_5dd07dd9ad.png)
For filters on a column that is not part of the primary key, such as `WHERE C2 > 900`, ClickHouse can use a lightweight projection, which stores the sorted projection key (`C2`) values plus `_part_offset` values and provides its own primary index (②) that allows granules to be pruned for filters on the projection key.


## Pruning technique \#3: Skip indexes [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#pruning_technique_3_skip_indexes)


Our final technique is [skip indexes](https://clickhouse.com/docs/optimize/skipping-indexes). One such skip index is the minmax index, which records the minimum and maximum values for a column for each granule.


Minmax indexes have been supported in ClickHouse for more than five years, but we’ve recently added support for automatically creating these indexes for every column of a specific type in a table.


The advantage of a minmax index over a lightweight projection is that it doesn’t duplicate the column values on disk. However, something to keep in mind is that the column on which we apply a minmax index needs to be somewhat correlated with the primary\-key, otherwise the index won’t effectively prune data.


In the diagram below, the minmax index (③) records the minimum and maximum values of `C3` for each granule.


![](/uploads/pruning_003_9950c00fa2.png)
For a filter like `WHERE C3 > 600`, granules `g1` to `g3` can be skipped because their maximum value is below 600, so only g4 needs to be read.


## Pruning in action: UK property dataset [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#pruning_in_action)


Now that we’ve got a high\-level understanding of each of the pruning techniques, let’s learn how to put them into action on a real\-life dataset. We’ll be using the [UK property prices dataset](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/uk-price-paid), which contains details of property sales in the UK.


We’ll run all queries on an Apple Mac M2 Max with 64GB of RAM.


### Ingesting the UK property dataset [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#ingesting-the-uk-property-dataset)


Let’s start by creating the table:



```

```
1CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE uk_price_paid
2(
3    price UInt32,
4    date Date,
5    postcode1 LowCardinality(String),
6    postcode2 LowCardinality(String),
7    type Enum8('terraced' = 1, 'semi-detached' = 2, 'detached' = 3, 'flat' = 4, 'other' = 0),
8    is_new UInt8,
9    duration Enum8('freehold' = 1, 'leasehold' = 2, 'unknown' = 0),
10    addr1 String,
11    addr2 String,
12    street LowCardinality(String),
13    locality LowCardinality(String),
14    town LowCardinality(String),
15    district LowCardinality(String),
16    county LowCardinality(String)
17)
18ENGINE = MergeTree
19ORDER BY (postcode1, postcode2, addr1, addr2);
```

```

The primary key (which is the same as the order by statement unless otherwise specified) is `(postcode1, postcode2, addr1, addr2)`.


Once the table’s created, we’ll ingest the data:



```

```
1INSERT INTO uk_price_paid
2SELECT *
3FROM file('uk_all.parquet');
```

```

I created `uk_all.parquet` by first importing the data from `pp-complete.csv` ([as documented](https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/uk-price-paid#preprocess-import-data)) and then exporting it to Parquet.


The output of running the insert query is shown below:



```

```
130452463 rows in set. Elapsed: 5.366 sec. Processed 30.45 million rows, 170.44 MB (5.68 million rows/s., 31.76 MB/s.)
2Peak memory usage: 774.00 MiB.
```

```

This dataset contains 30 million rows, which is relatively small by ClickHouse’s standards. We could increase the amount of data by ingesting the Parquet multiple times, but there’s a faster way, using [`ATTACH PARTITION`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#attach-partitionpart).


The following command duplicates all the parts in the table, doubling the amount of data:



```

```
1ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid 
2ATTACH PARTITION ID 'all' 
3FROM uk_price_paid;
```

```

I ran it several times so that we have a decent amount of data to work with. For reference, the following is the output from running the query three times:



```
0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.167 sec.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.458 sec.

0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.412 sec.

```

We can write the following query to return the count of records in our table:



```

```
1SELECT count()
2FROM uk_price_paid;
```

```


```
┌───count()─┐
│ 243619704 │ -- 243.62 million
└───────────┘

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.001 sec.

```

### Filtering by primary index [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#filtering-by-primary-index)


Let’s start by writing a query that filters on the primary key. The following query returns the number of properties sold in Croydon (a suburb of London) as well as the average sale price:



```

```
1SELECT postcode1, count(), avg(price)
2FROM uk_price_paid
3WHERE postcode1 LIKE 'CR%'
4GROUP BY ALL
5ORDER BY count() DESC
6SETTINGS 
7  output_format_pretty_single_large_number_tip_threshold=0,
8  use_query_condition_cache=0;
```

```

The output of running the query is shown below:



```
┌─postcode1─┬─count()─┬─────────avg(price)─┐
│ CR0       │  573952 │  264860.4016363738 │
│ CR2       │  219464 │ 287568.45715014765 │

└───────────┴─────────┴────────────────────┘

```


```
10 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.030 sec.

10 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.015 sec.

10 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.021 sec.

```

The best query time was 15 milliseconds, which is not bad for a query on a table containing more than 200 million records.


If we prefix this query with `EXPLAIN indexes=1, pretty=1, compact=1`, we can see the query plan:



```
    ┌─explain─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 1. │ Output: postcode1, count(), avg(price)              │

14. │            Ranges: 36                               │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

```

On line 12, we can see that the query engine only needed to process 235 of the 29,751 granules (less than 1%) to run this query.


We can see how many rows were processed by querying the `system.query_log` table:



```

```
1SELECT event_time, query, read_rows
2FROM system.query_log
3WHERE type = 'QueryFinish' AND query NOT LIKE '%query_log%'
4ORDER BY event_time DESC 
5LIMIT 1
6FORMAT Vertical;
```

```


```
Row 1:
──────
event_time: 2026-04-09 10:37:22
query:      SELECT postcode1, count(), avg(price)...
read_rows:  1687552 -- 1.69 million

```

Our query reads 1\.6 million rows from a potential 243 million, so it’s fair to say the primary index has done a good job of reducing the data we need to read.


The primary index will be effective when filtering multiple columns that are part of the primary key, provided they form a prefix of the entire key.


Our primary key is `(postcode1, postcode2, addr1, addr2)`, so filtering on, for example, `postcode1` and `postcode2` will be efficient.



```

```
1SELECT postcode1, postcode2, count(), avg(price)
2FROM uk_price_paid
3WHERE postcode1 LIKE 'CR%' AND postcode2 LIKE '4%'
4GROUP BY ALL
5ORDER BY count() DESC 
6LIMIT 10
7SETTINGS
8  output_format_pretty_single_large_number_tip_threshold=0,
9  use_query_condition_cache=0;
```

```


```

```

This query processes just over 630,000 rows out of 243 million.


Filtering only on `postcode2`, which is part of the primary key, but isn’t the first key column, won’t be as efficient:



```

```
1SELECT postcode1, postcode2, count(), avg(price)

```

It now scans 138 million rows and takes 50 times longer to return a result. If we explain this query, we’ll see the following output:



```

    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


```

The query engine can use the primary key to exclude almost half of the granules (line 15\), but on line 16, we see it’s using the [generic exclusion search algorithm](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/best-practices/sparse-primary-indexes#generic-exclusion-search-algorithm).


The efficiency of this algorithm depends on the cardinality difference between the `postcode2` column and its predecessor key column, `postcode1`. You can see a step\-by\-step example in the documentation, but the takeaway is that the algorithm is efficient when the predecessor column has low(er) cardinality, but not so efficient when it has high(er) cardinality.


In the next section, we’re going to see how to filter more efficiently by columns that aren’t part of the primary key at all.


### Filtering by lightweight projection [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#filtering-by-lightweight-projection)


Filtering by primary index is the best technique, and making sure that you sort the data by the columns that you’re most likely to filter against is a good thing to keep in mind when designing your tables.


But often, we want to query by other columns as well. For example, let’s say we want to find the number of properties sold by town when the `district = ‘BURNLEY’`:



```

```
1SELECT town, count(), round(avg(price)) AS avgPrice, argAndMax(date, price)
2FROM uk_price_paid
3WHERE district = 'BURNLEY'
4GROUP BY ALL
5ORDER BY count() DESC LIMIT 10
6SETTINGS
7    use_query_condition_cache = 0;
```

```


```

```

The output from running this query several times is shown below:



```

```

The query engine has to process almost all the rows in the dataset in order to answer this query.


Let’s see if we can improve the performance by adding a lightweight projection on the `district` column:



```

```
1ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid
2ADD PROJECTION by_district INDEX district TYPE basic;
```

```

We’ll materialize that projection so that we can use it straight away:



```

```
1ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid
2MATERIALIZE PROJECTION by_district
3SETTINGS mutations_sync=1;
```

```


```
0 rows in set. Elapsed: 14.480 sec.

```

Now, let’s run the query with the projection:



```

```
1SELECT town, count(), round(avg(price)) AS avgPrice, argAndMax(date, price)
2FROM uk_price_paid
3WHERE district = 'BURNLEY'
4GROUP BY ALL
5ORDER BY count() DESC LIMIT 10
6SETTINGS
7    use_query_condition_cache = 0,
8    optimize_use_projections = 1;
```

```

`optimize_use_projections` is enabled by default, but we included it here for completeness. If you turn it off, projections won’t be used. It’s useful for sanity checking that your projection is actually working!


The timings of running the above query are shown below:



```
10 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.023 sec.

10 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.056 sec.

10 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.046 sec.

```

For the `BURNLEY` query, using a lightweight projection on the `district` column reduces the query time from 428 milliseconds to 23 milliseconds, a 94% improvement.


Let’s now have a look at what’s going on under the hood. I initially prefixed the query with the same explain clause that we used earlier:



```

```
1EXPLAIN indexes=1, pretty=1, compact= 1 
2SELECT town, count(), round(avg(price)) AS avgPrice, argAndMax(date, price)
3FROM uk_price_paid
4WHERE district = 'BURNLEY'
5GROUP BY ALL
6ORDER BY count() DESC LIMIT 10
7SETTINGS
8    use_query_condition_cache = 0,
9    optimize_use_projections = 1;
```

```


```

```

This output doesn’t help us as it only includes the base query plan with the primary key index information. We need to also add `projections=1` so that projection analysis is included in the output:



```

```

```

Let’s go through what’s happening here, starting with the **Indexes** section:


The primary key index couldn't help with this query \- `Condition: true` on Row 9 means it applied no filtering, so all 11 parts (Row 10\) and 29,744 granules (Row 11\) have to be considered.


Moving on to the **Projections** section


- `Filtered Parts: 0` on Row 22 indicates that no parts could be eliminated entirely, which means `BURNLEY` appears in all 11 parts.
- Row 19 narrows the search to 72 granules (or marks)
- Each granule contains 8,192 rows by default, which gives us the count on line 21 (72 \* 8,192\=589,824\)
- Those 72 granules are spread across 11 parts (Row 18\), and since `BURNLEY` rows are stored contiguously within each part, that gives us one continuous range per part \- 11 ranges in total (Row 20\).


The table below shows the times without projection and with projection for districts with both more and fewer properties sold than Burnley:




| District | Matching rows | No projection (ms) | Projection (ms) | Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BIRMINGHAM | 3,543,672 | 341 | 82 | 76% |
| SHEFFIELD | 1,975,368 | 368 | 44 | 88% |
| CROYDON | 1,448,472 | 364 | 48 | 86% |
| WAKEFIELD | 1,322,216 | 382 | 50 | 87% |
| WIRRAL | 1,301,168 | 358 | 39 | 89% |
| SOUTHWARK | 999,432 | 367 | 30 | 92% |
| SUTTON | 875,872 | 361 | 45 | 87% |



> I ran the query three times with the projection and three times without it, and took the lowest times.


We see at least a 75% improvement in query time for all these districts when using the projection.


One cool feature of lightweight projections is that we can combine them to get row\-level filtering across multiple independent sort orders.
For example, we could add another lightweight projection on the `date` column:



```

```
1ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid
2ADD PROJECTION by_date INDEX date TYPE basic;
3
4ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid
5MATERIALIZE PROJECTION by_date
6SETTINGS mutations_sync=1;
```

```

A query that filters by both `district` and `date` (e.g. finding properties sold in Manchester in January 2023\) would use both of these lightweight projections:



```

```
1SELECT town, 
2       count(),
3       round(avg(price)) AS avgPrice,
4       argAndMax(date, price)
5FROM uk_price_paid
6WHERE (district = 'MANCHESTER') AND (date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31')
7GROUP BY ALL
8ORDER BY count() DESC
9LIMIT 10
10SETTINGS
11    use_query_condition_cache = 0,
12    optimize_use_projections = 1;
```

```


```
┌─town───────┬─count()─┬─avgPrice─┬─argAndMax(date, price)─┐

```

Each projection independently works out which parts and granules match for their filter condition and the set of rows to read from the base table is the intersection of both.


To see the impact of the lightweight projections individually and together, we’re going to create a couple of extra tables, each containing one of the lightweight projections.


First up, `uk_price_paid_by_date` will only have the `by_date` lightweight projection:



```

```
1CREATE TABLE uk_price_paid_by_date
2CLONE AS uk_price_paid;
3
4ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid_by_date 
5DROP PROJECTION by_district;
```

```

And `uk_price_paid_by_district` will only have the `by_district` lightweight projection:



```

```
1CREATE TABLE uk_price_paid_by_district 
2CLONE AS uk_price_paid;
3
4ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid_by_district 
5DROP PROJECTION by_date;
```

```

We’ll now run our previous query that finds properties sold in Manchester in January 2023 against each table. We’ll run it against each table three times, recording the lowest time and the rows processed:




| Table | Query time (ms) | Rows processed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uk_price_paid` | 52 | 2\.24 million |
| `uk_price_paid_by_district` | 67 | 8\.03 million |
| `uk_price_paid_by_date` | 347 | 243\.46 million |


We don't really see much improvement with just the `by_date` lightweight projection. Even though the projection has narrowed down the matching rows to around 500,000 (properties sold in January 2023\), those rows are scattered across all 243 million rows in the base table, so the query engine still has to visit most of the data to retrieve them and then filter the district to Manchester.


We can confirm what we’re seeing above by writing the following query to work out how many granules need to be scanned to find all the matching rows for properties sold in January 2023:



```

```
1SELECT
2    uniqExact((_part, intDiv(_part_offset, 8192))) AS granulesWithMatchingRows,
3    (
4        SELECT sum(marks)
5        FROM system.parts
6        WHERE (`table` = 'uk_price_paid_by_date') AND active
7    ) AS totalGranules,
8    round((granulesWithMatchingRows / totalGranules) * 100, 2) AS pct
9FROM uk_price_paid_by_date
10WHERE (date >= '2023-01-01') AND (date <= '2023-01-31');
```

```


```
┌─granulesWithMatchingRows─┬─totalGranules─┬──pct─┐
│                    29724 │         29755 │ 99.9 │
└──────────────────────────┴───────────────┴──────┘

```

We’re scanning 29,724 granules, or around 243,499,008 rows (29,724\*8,192\), to find the matching rows.


Let’s have a look at another example where we’re filtering more specifically by date and more liberally by district. The following query finds property sales on 1st February 2023 in Manchester, Birmingham, Sutton, and Wirral:



```

```
1SELECT town,
2       count(),
3       round(avg(price)) AS avgPrice,
4       argAndMax(date, price)
5FROM uk_price_paid
6WHERE (district IN ('MANCHESTER', 'BIRMINGHAM', 'SUTTON', 'WIRRAL'))
7AND (date = '2023-02-01')
8GROUP BY ALL
9ORDER BY count() DESC
10LIMIT 10
11SETTINGS
12    use_query_condition_cache = 0,
13    optimize_use_projections = 1;
```

```

And again, we’ll run it against each table three times, recording the lowest time and the rows processed:




| Table | Query time (ms) | Rows processed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uk_price_paid` | 85 | 58\.92 million |
| `uk_price_paid_by_district` | 352 | 207\.67 million |
| `uk_price_paid_by_date` | 99 | 75\.85 million |


This time, `by_date` does a better job of filtering the data than `by_district`, but we get the best performance when both lightweight projections work together.


### Filtering by minmax index [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#filtering-by-minmax-index)


Our final pruning technique is the minmax index, a type of skip index. As a quick reminder, any column we add a skip index to must be correlated with the primary key; otherwise, the index won’t be effective.


We’re going to add a minmax index to the `price` column to filter prices more efficiently. Prices are loosely correlated with postcode because properties in the same geographic area tend to sell in similar price ranges: expensive London postcodes (SW1, W1\) cluster toward the high end, while rural postcodes cluster toward the lower end. This means that the query engine should be able to skip granules when searching by price.


We can add the minmax index with the following query:



```

```
1ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid
2ADD INDEX price_minmax price TYPE minmax GRANULARITY 1;
```

```

We’ll materialize that index so that we can use it straight away:



```

```
1ALTER TABLE uk_price_paid
2MATERIALIZE INDEX price_minmax
3SETTINGS mutations_sync=1;
```

```

Next, we’re going to write a query to find the district that has the most properties sold for more than £10,000,000:



```

```
1SELECT
2    district,
3    count(),
4    formatReadableQuantity(avg(price)) AS avgPrice
5FROM uk_price_paid
6WHERE price > 10000000
7GROUP BY ALL
8ORDER BY count() DESC
9LIMIT 10
10SETTINGS use_query_condition_cache = 0,
11         use_skip_indexes = 1;
```

```


> The `use_skip_indexes` setting is true by default, but we can turn it off to see the impact of skip indexes.


The result of running the query is shown below:



```

The best time without the skip index was 234 milliseconds, compared to 304 milliseconds with the skip index, a roughly 23% improvement.


The query with the skip index was processing about 1/2 as many rows. We can see what data was being ignored by explaining the query:



```

```
1EXPLAIN indexes=1, projections=1, pretty=1, compact=1
```

```

The output is shown below:

From line 17, we can see that the skip index excluded just over 15,000 granules.


## Conclusion [\#](/blog/index-based-pruning#conclusion)


This blog post has taken us through three index\-based pruning techniques offered by ClickHouse: primary index, lightweight projections, and skip indexes.


The primary index is the most powerful. You should design your `ORDER BY` around your most common filter columns.


Lightweight projections are a good option for filtering on non\-primary key columns. Combining multiple projections lets ClickHouse intersect its results for even better pruning.


And finally, skip indexes like minmax work best when the target column is correlated with the primary key; without that correlation, they won't help much.
